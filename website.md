## About Pong

Pong is a two dimensional table tennis game that was originally released in 1972. The game can be played against a computer, or two people can play each other. Each player has a rectangular paddle, which is on opposite sides of the screen. The players control the position position of their paddle by using up and down controls. The players must move their paddles in order to hit a ball, which reverses direction when it hits a paddle or the top and bottom border of the screen. If the ball goes passed one player’s paddle, the other player gets a point, and the ball resets.

My specific version of Pong is slightly different than the original because it includes an extra feature. My game includes powerups, which are small colorful circles that can spawn randomly on the play area. When the ball collides with the powerup, one of three things can happen. The ball can increase in speed, reverse direction, or shrink the paddle size of both players.
